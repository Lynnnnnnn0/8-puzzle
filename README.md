# 8-puzzle
* use various algorithms to solve n-puzzle, tested on 8-puzzle
  * Breadth-First Search
  * Depth-First Search
  * A-Star Search
  * IDA-Star Search
* output the following to compare between the above algorithms:
  * path_to_goal: the sequence of moves taken to reach the goal
  * cost_of_path: the number of moves taken to reach the goal
  * nodes_expanded: the number of nodes that have been expanded
  * fringe_size: the size of the frontier set when the goal node is found
  * max_fringe_size: the maximum size of the frontier set in the lifetime of the algorithm
  * search_depth: the depth within the search tree when the goal node is found
  * max_search_depth: the maximum depth of the search tree in the lifetime of the algorithm
  * running_time: the total running time of the search instance, reported in seconds
  * max_ram_usage: the maximum RAM usage in the lifetime of the process as measured by
  * the ru_maxrss attribute in the resource module, reported in megabytes
